## Getting Started

Since the source code is provided, it is possible to simply clone the entire repository with the link provided [here](https://github.com/EnergiAwareness/Capp/archive/master.zip "here").
If you simply want to run the program, without opening the .sln you can do so in the folder **Program**, which has all the required files and some example devices already-provided, here you can run **Capp.exe** which has the latest release.
Please do note we only support **Windows!**

## Prerequisites
This program was developed in **C** using **Visual Studio Community 2019**, and as such it is recommended the **CApp.sln** is opened using that software.
